# Stock-Price-Prediction
Worked with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. Implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM. 

Linear Regression

RMSE=121.16291596523156

The RMSE value is higher, which clearly shows that linear regression has performed poorly

k-Nearest Neighbours

RMSE=115.17086550026721

There is not a huge difference in the RMSE value of KNN and linear regression

Auto ARIMA

RMSE=44.954584993246954

The predictions using this technique are far better than that of the previously implemented machine learning models, these predictions are still not close to the real values.

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

RMSE=11.772259608962642

This gives the best result as compare to previous algorithms
